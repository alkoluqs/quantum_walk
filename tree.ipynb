    "Many particle quantum random walk\n",
    "Simulation evolution of spatial entanglement in many-body physics problems. The graph is a 1D lattice with a particle on each node as initial state. Each particle has separate position and coin hilbert space H = (Hc ⊗ Hp)⊗M. The particles independantly evolve and don't interact. 3-particle system graph are easily implemented in quantum walk but more particles increase number of steps in quantum walk and measurement of entanglement become difficult. More efficient methods of quantum walk implementation will help increase the number of particle systems studied in evolution.\n",
    "Expansion of number of nodes on graph\n",
    "The graph implemented in this project is 3 qubits for 8 nodes and 1 qubit for coin operation. In total only 4 qubits are used for evolution. The total time for iterating through coin and shift operator is 16 seconds for 100 flips. We look at a real world problem that can be applied in quantum random walk on graphs with more nodes. Mapping enzymes as nodes on a graph to understand their evolution when in contact with mutagens only requires 33 nodes which can be mapped out on 7 qubit circuit. This will increase total time to 49 seconds for 100 flips. This is a scalable model which can continue to grow to map more complex graphs to problems.\n",
